## Praat scripts

This folder contains Praat scripts I have written.

#### formant_measurement
This scripts goes through all sound files and their corresponding TextGrids, finds all labeled intervals and measures the first three formant 20 times in the marked interval. It is possible to analyse one specific label only, by unmarking the lines in the orm and at the beginning of the tree choice.
